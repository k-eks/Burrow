Cheat sheet
===========

when I say "run script.py" it referes to the correct function inside the file

1) XDS
    1a) Make a full refinement in XDS
    1b) Open the BGKPIX.cbf in Albula and save it as a h5 file
    1c) You will need the GXPARMS file MUCH later for the meerkat reconstructions

2) BG and hot pixel filtering
    2a) run background.py with a percentile of around 3, this is your background
    2b) run background.py again, this time with a high percentile of >50. All pixel with an intensity way beyond average are the hot pixel
    2c) run puncher.py to generate a list of hot pixel, you will need this list in the next step

3) Punch and fill (easy enough)
    3a) run puncher.py
    3b) run filler.py


Additional info:
the meerkat_tools provides a function for converting the meerkat data format into the yell data format and a function for generating weights, this is required to mask the gaps of the detector
